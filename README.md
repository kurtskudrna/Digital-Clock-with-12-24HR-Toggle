## Digital Clock with 12/24 Hr Toggle
This project is a Digital Clock that features a background image of space with a 12/24 Hr toggle to change from normal to military time.
## Motivation
When I saw the Google font Orbitron, I knew I wanted to make a project with some space elements. I haven't made a digital clock yet so I decided to do so.
I also wanted to add the toggle as I believe it would help up the difficulty from the other date object projects I was doing.
